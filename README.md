# Introduction
A job stimulation is a risk-free way to experience work on the job, to prractice your skills with example tasks and build your confidence to ace your applications.
This virtual internship is conducted by the Tata Group.

Tata Group is a global conglomerate which operates in more than 100 countries across six continents, with a mission 'To improve the quality of life of the communities we serve globally, through long-term stakeholder value creation based on Leadership with Trustâ€™.

There are 29 publicly listed Tata enterprises â€“ many being market leaders in their industries. This job simulation is with one of their companies, Tata Insights and Quants.

## Problem Statement 

An online retail store wants to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to **analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue** so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. **Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well** so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

There are Four tasks in this virtual internship programme
  1.  Framing the Business Scenario
  2.  Choosing the Right Visuals
  3.  Creating Effective vizuals
  4.  Communicating insights and Analysis

## Dataset 

The dataset contained 541,910 records spanning 38 countries, with the majority of stores located in the United Kingdom and hence is excluded in the report as to concentrate on the countries with potential for expansion.

# Framing the Business Scenario
For this task(1) I was asked to draft a set 8 questions that would be important, relavent to the CEO and CMO of the store and I anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. (4 questions to each).

## The questions I framed:
**CEO:**
1. What insights can be drawn from the study of the data?  how have the KPI'S changed from the past year?
2. which products have the most sales and what are the demographics of the customers purchasing those products?
3. How is our current market position compared to our main competitors based on the data? 
4. Do our financial metrics and overall performance align with our forecasting and projections?

**CMO:**
1. Which marketing procedures or channels were the most effective for bringing in the customers and how to optimize these strategies?
2. Can we observe any seasonal or time change patterns that affect the increase of sales?
3. What current trends would be relevant for us to adapt in our future campaigns?
4. what are the most important factors that increase the customer churn rate and how to reduce the churn rate using marketing?

# Creating Effective Visuals
- In this task, I was asked to create around 4 visuals for the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested.
- I later used these vizuals to futher create a detailed and interactive report to understand and gain more insights to aid the store's expansion plans.
- The data was cleaned accordingly prior to creating the report in Power BI.
- The following questions were asked by the CEO and CMO:
  
**Question 1**
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur.

**Question 2**
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

**Question 3**
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

**Question 4**
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions.(Exclude United Kingdom)

# Insights and Recommedations
1. In the first page of the report I have created overview of the stores sales, by calculating and displaying the key performance indicators such as revenue, total orders, top customers, etc.
2. Total of **20k orders** were placed across 35+ countries generating **$11M revenue** during the years mid 2010 to 2011.
3. The store operates online and sells over 4000 products of which **6M quantities** were sold.
4. The most revenue generated was in the month of **Nov -2011** ($1.5M).
5. Upon visualizing the data for the top 10 customers, it becomes evident that **customer_id 14646** contributes the highest revenue.
6. The highest revenue generating product was found to be **Paper Crafted little birdie**.
7. To help the organisation in planning their expansion strategy, a page to view overall contribution by each country was created in which united kingdom was excluded.
8. The Top 5 countries based on revenue were found to be -**Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, Australia**
9. It is recommeded to the organisation to open more stores in the above countries to boost revenue.
10. **More awareness, Ad campaigns** should be promoted in countries that are at the lower end of top 10 list such as japan, sweden and belgium
11. The months of **February and April consistently exhibit the lowest sales** figures. Further investigation is required to identify the contributing factors and implement necessary adjustments
